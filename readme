Problem Statement:
You are a Data Scientist for a tourism company named "Visit with us". The Policy Maker of the company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base.A viable business model is a central concept that helps you to understand the existing ways of doing the business and how to change the ways for the benefit of the tourism sector.One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages.Currently, there are 5 types of packages the company is offering - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King. Looking at the data of the last year, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages.However, the marketing cost was quite high because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information.

The company is now planning to launch a new product i.e. Wellness Tourism Package. Wellness Tourism is defined as Travel that allows the traveler to maintain, enhance or kick-start a healthy lifestyle, and support or increase one's sense of well-being.However, this time company wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to make the marketing expenditure more efficient.

You as a Data Scientist at "Visit with us" travel company has to analyze the customers' data and information to provide recommendations to the Policy Maker and Marketing Team and also build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced travel package.

Objective:
  To build a model to predict which customer is potentially going to purchase the newly introduced travel package.

Data Description:
  CustomerID: Unique customer ID
  ProdTaken: Whether the customer has purchased a package or not (0: No, 1: Yes)
  Age: Age of customer
  TypeofContact: How customer was contacted (Company Invited or Self Inquiry)
  CityTier: City tier depends on the development of a city, population, facilities, and living standards. The categories are ordered i.e. Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3
  DurationOfPitch: Duration of the pitch by a salesperson to the customer
  Occupation: Occupation of customer
  Gender: Gender of customer
  NumberOfPersonVisiting: Total number of persons planning to take the trip with the customer
  NumberOfFollowups: Total number of follow-ups has been done by the salesperson after the sales pitch
  ProductPitched: Product pitched by the salesperson
  PreferredPropertyStar: Preferred hotel property rating by customer
  MaritalStatus: Marital status of customer
  NumberOfTrips: Average number of trips in a year by customer
  Passport: The customer has a passport or not (0: No, 1: Yes)
  PitchSatisfactionScore: Sales pitch satisfaction score
  OwnCar: Whether the customers own a car or not (0: No, 1: Yes)
  NumberOfChildrenVisiting: Total number of children with age less than 5 planning to take the trip with the customer
  Designation: Designation of the customer in the current organization
  MonthlyIncome: Gross monthly income of the customer
  
Used Ensemble Technique to build this projecjt and some details on what Ensemble Technique means and what it does.

Ensemble Methods
  Ensemble is a group of estimators that are used together for prediction in classification as well as regression problems.
  Ensemble is the belief that a committee of experts working together are more likely to be accurate than individual experts.
  Ensemble method uses n number of base estimators and combines their output to give a final prediction giving better performance and robustness than a single estimator.
  For ensemble to be effective we have to ensure
  The base estimators are as different from each other as possible.
  The errors made by each estimator should be different from each other (independent errors)
  Bagging and Boosting are two ensemble methods.

Bagging	Boosting
  All the weak learners are built in parallel i.e. independent of each other	Successive weak learners to improve the accuracy from the prior learners	
  Each weak learner has equal weight in the final prediction.	More weight to those weak learners with better performance	
  Samples are drawn from the original dataset with replacement to train each individual weak learner	Subsequent samples have more of those observations which had relatively higher errors in previous weak learners	
  Can help reduce variance of the mode	Can help reduce bias of the mode	
  Example: Bagging Classifier, Random Forest	Example: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier
